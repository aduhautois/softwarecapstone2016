This is the capstone project for the Software Development program for the class of 2016. I was brought into the capstone class from the web department to develop and design the web front end for an ASP.NET MVC web application called GreenThumb, a community garden organization/task management application.

##What's Inside

The capstone project includes two different applications, a desktop app and a web app:

  * WPF desktop application designed by separate team
  * ASP.NET MVC web application
    * designed by aduhautois
  * database
